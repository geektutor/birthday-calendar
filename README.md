# Birthday Calendar

A Birthday Notification App.

We've all forgotten our friends and family birthday at least once, even Facebook notifications aren't enough (what if they aren't on Facebook or you didn't bother checking Facebook), what if they themselves never posted their own Birthday beforehand or you simply just forgot about it.

Birthday Calendar is here to address this issue, Here's how it works

1. You register on the application.
1. You store your friends birthday dates.
1. You get notified when it's their birthday

* You can also create a group of people and all the members of the group will be notfied when it's each other birthdays.
* You can share your birthday details with friends so they don't forget the date.
* You can Integrate the application with Google Calendar so you get notified there too.


* `my thoughts tho` Automatic extraction & saving of friends birthday dates from socials like Facebook directly into the application.
